# Extreme-winds

In the context of extreme winds estimation, one data set of wind measurements fromthe DTU Høvsøre test station in Jutland, Denmark, was analysed. It contains 10-minutes averaged wind speeds and the correspondent wind direction (which is not taking into accountfor this analysis) for almost 16 years. 
The method for estimation of the V_50 is the Annual Maxima to fit a Gumbel distribution.
